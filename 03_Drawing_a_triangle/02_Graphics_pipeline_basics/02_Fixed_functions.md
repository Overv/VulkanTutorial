The older graphics APIs provided default state for most of the stages of the
graphics pipeline. In Vulkan you have to be explicit about everything, from
viewport size to color blending function. In this chapter we'll fill in all of
the structures to configure these fixed-function operations.

## Vertex input

The `VkPipelineVertexInputStateCreateInfo` structure describes the format of the
vertex data that will be passed to the vertex shader. It describes this in
roughly two ways:

* Bindings: spacing between data and whether the data is per-vertex or
per-instance (see [instancing](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Geometry_instancing))
* Attribute descriptions: type of the attributes passed to the vertex shader,
which binding to load them from and at which offset

Because we're hard coding the vertex data directly in the vertex shader, we'll
fill in this structure to specify that there is no vertex data to load for now.
We'll get back to it in the vertex buffer chapter.

```c++
VkPipelineVertexInputStateCreateInfo vertexInputInfo = {};
vertexInputInfo.sType = VK_STRUCTURE_TYPE_PIPELINE_VERTEX_INPUT_STATE_CREATE_INFO;
vertexInputInfo.vertexBindingDescriptionCount = 0;
vertexInputInfo.pVertexBindingDescriptions = nullptr; // Optional
vertexInputInfo.vertexAttributeDescriptionCount = 0;
vertexInputInfo.pVertexAttributeDescriptions = nullptr; // Optional
```

The `pVertexBindingDescriptions` and `pVertexAttributeDescriptions` members
point to an array of structs that describe the aforementioned details for
loading vertex data. Add this structure to the `createGraphicsPipeline` function
right after the `shaderStages` array.

## Input assembly

The `VkPipelineInputAssemblyStateCreateInfo` struct describes two things: what
kind of geometry will be drawn from the vertices and if primitive restart should
be enabled. The former is specified in the `topology` member and can have values
like:

* `VK_PRIMITIVE_TOPOLOGY_POINT_LIST`: points from vertices
* `VK_PRIMITIVE_TOPOLOGY_LINE_LIST`: line from every 2 vertices without reuse
* `VK_PRIMITIVE_TOPOLOGY_LINE_STRIP`: every second vertex is used as start
vertex for the next line
* `VK_PRIMITIVE_TOPOLOGY_TRIANGLE_LIST`: triangle from every 3 vertices without
reuse
* `VK_PRIMITIVE_TOPOLOGY_TRIANGLE_STRIP `: every third vertex is used as first
vertex for the next triangle

Normally, the vertices are loaded from the vertex buffer by index in sequential
order, but with an *element buffer* you can specify the indices to use yourself.
This allows you to perform optimizations like reusing vertices. If you set the
`primitiveRestartEnable`  member to `VK_TRUE`, then it's possible to break up
lines and triangles in the `_STRIP` topology modes by using a special index of
`0xFFFF` or `0xFFFFFFFF`.

We intend to draw triangles throughout this tutorial, so we'll stick to the
following data for the structure:

```c++
VkPipelineInputAssemblyStateCreateInfo inputAssembly = {};
inputAssembly.sType = VK_STRUCTURE_TYPE_PIPELINE_INPUT_ASSEMBLY_STATE_CREATE_INFO;
inputAssembly.topology = VK_PRIMITIVE_TOPOLOGY_TRIANGLE_LIST;
inputAssembly.primitiveRestartEnable = VK_FALSE;
```

## Viewports and scissors

A viewport basically describes the region of the framebuffer that the output
will be rendered to. This will almost always be `(0, 0)` to `(width, height)`
and in this tutorial that will also be the case.

```c++
VkViewport viewport = {};
viewport.x = 0.0f;
viewport.y = 0.0f;
viewport.width = (float) swapChainExtent.width;
viewport.height = (float) swapChainExtent.height;
viewport.minDepth = 0.0f;
viewport.maxDepth = 1.0f;
```

Remember that the size of the swap chain and its images may differ from the
`WIDTH` and `HEIGHT` of the window. The swap chain images will be used as
framebuffers later on, so we should stick to their size.

The `minDepth` and `maxDepth` values specify the range of depth values to use
for the framebuffer. These values must be within the `[0.0f, 1.0f]` range, but
`minDepth` may be higher than `maxDepth`. If you aren't doing anything special,
then you should stick to the standard values of `0.0f` and `1.0f`.

While viewports define the transformation from the image to the framebuffer,
scissor rectangles define in which regions pixels will actually be stored. Any
pixels outside the scissor rectangles will be discarded by the rasterizer. They
function like a filter rather than a transformation. The difference is
illustrated below. Note that the left scissor rectangle is just one of the many
possibilities that would result in that image, as long as it's larger than the
viewport.

![](/images/viewports_scissors.png)

In this tutorial we simply want to draw to the entire framebuffer, so we'll
specify a scissor rectangle that covers it entirely:

```c++
VkRect2D scissor = {};
scissor.offset = {0, 0};
scissor.extent = swapChainExtent;
```

Now this viewport and scissor rectangle need to be combined into a viewport
state using the `VkPipelineViewportStateCreateInfo` struct. It is possible to
use multiple viewports and scissor rectangles on some graphics cards, so its
members reference an array of them. Using multiple requires enabling a GPU
feature (see logical device creation).

```c++
VkPipelineViewportStateCreateInfo viewportState = {};
viewportState.sType = VK_STRUCTURE_TYPE_PIPELINE_VIEWPORT_STATE_CREATE_INFO;
viewportState.viewportCount = 1;
viewportState.pViewports = &viewport;
viewportState.scissorCount = 1;
viewportState.pScissors = &scissor;
```

## Rasterizer

The rasterizer takes the geometry that is shaped by the vertices from the vertex
shader and turns it into fragments to be colored by the fragment shader. It also
performs [depth testing](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Z-buffering),
[face culling](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Back-face_culling) and the scissor
test, and it can be configured to output fragments that fill entire polygons or
just the edges (wireframe rendering). All this is configured using the
`VkPipelineRasterizationStateCreateInfo` structure.

```c++
VkPipelineRasterizationStateCreateInfo rasterizer = {};
rasterizer.sType = VK_STRUCTURE_TYPE_PIPELINE_RASTERIZATION_STATE_CREATE_INFO;
rasterizer.depthClampEnable = VK_FALSE;
```

If `depthClampEnable` is set to `VK_TRUE`, then fragments that are beyond the
near and far planes are clamped to them as opposed to discarding them. This is
useful in some special cases like shadow maps. Using this requires enabling a
GPU feature.

```c++
rasterizer.rasterizerDiscardEnable = VK_FALSE;
```

If `rasterizerDiscardEnable` is set to `VK_TRUE`, then geometry never passes
through the rasterizer stage. This basically disables any output to the
framebuffer.

```c++
rasterizer.polygonMode = VK_POLYGON_MODE_FILL;
```

The `polygonMode` determines how fragments are generated for geometry. The
following modes are available:

* `VK_POLYGON_MODE_FILL`: fill the area of the polygon with fragments
* `VK_POLYGON_MODE_LINE`: polygon edges are drawn as lines
* `VK_POLYGON_MODE_POINT`: polygon vertices are drawn as points

Using any mode other than fill requires enabling a GPU feature.

```c++
rasterizer.lineWidth = 1.0f;
```

The `lineWidth` member is straightforward, it describes the thickness of lines
in terms of number of fragments. The maximum line width that is supported
depends on the hardware and any line thicker than `1.0f` requires you to enable
the `wideLines` GPU feature.

```c++
rasterizer.cullMode = VK_CULL_MODE_BACK_BIT;
rasterizer.frontFace = VK_FRONT_FACE_CLOCKWISE;
```

The `cullMode` variable determines the type of face culling to use. You can
disable culling, cull the front faces, cull the back faces or both. The
`frontFace` variable specifies the vertex order for faces to be considered
front-facing and can be clockwise or counterclockwise.

```c++
rasterizer.depthBiasEnable = VK_FALSE;
rasterizer.depthBiasConstantFactor = 0.0f; // Optional
rasterizer.depthBiasClamp = 0.0f; // Optional
rasterizer.depthBiasSlopeFactor = 0.0f; // Optional
```

The rasterizer can alter the depth values by adding a constant value or biasing
them based on a fragment's slope. This is sometimes used for shadow mapping, but
we won't be using it. Just set `depthBiasEnable` to `VK_FALSE`.

## Multisampling

The `VkPipelineMultisampleStateCreateInfo` struct configures multisampling,
which is one of the ways to perform [anti-aliasing](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Multisample_anti-aliasing).
It works by combining the fragment shader results of multiple polygons that
rasterize to the same pixel. This mainly occurs along edges, which is also where
the most noticeable aliasing artifacts occur. Because it doesn't need to run the
fragment shader multiple times if only one polygon maps to a pixel, it is
significantly less expensive than simply rendering to a higher resolution and
then downscaling. Enabling it requires enabling a GPU feature.

```c++
VkPipelineMultisampleStateCreateInfo multisampling = {};
multisampling.sType = VK_STRUCTURE_TYPE_PIPELINE_MULTISAMPLE_STATE_CREATE_INFO;
multisampling.sampleShadingEnable = VK_FALSE;
multisampling.rasterizationSamples = VK_SAMPLE_COUNT_1_BIT;
multisampling.minSampleShading = 1.0f; // Optional
multisampling.pSampleMask = nullptr; // Optional
multisampling.alphaToCoverageEnable = VK_FALSE; // Optional
multisampling.alphaToOneEnable = VK_FALSE; // Optional
```

In this tutorial we'll not be using multisampling, but feel free to experiment
with it. See the specification for the meaning of each parameter.

## Depth and stencil testing

If you are using a depth and/or stencil buffer, then you also need to configure
the depth and stencil tests using `VkPipelineDepthStencilStateCreateInfo`. We
don't have one right now, so we can simply pass a `nullptr` instead of a pointer
to such a struct. We'll get back to it in the depth buffering chapter.

## Color blending

After a fragment shader has returned a color, it needs to be combined with the
color that is already in the framebuffer. This transformation is known as color
blending and there are two ways to do it:

* Mix the old and new value to produce a final color
* Combine the old and new value using a bitwise operation

There are two types of structs to configure color blending. The first struct,
`VkPipelineColorBlendAttachmentState` contains the configuration per attached
framebuffer and the second struct, `VkPipelineColorBlendStateCreateInfo`
contains the *global* color blending settings. In our case we only have one
framebuffer:

```c++
VkPipelineColorBlendAttachmentState colorBlendAttachment = {};
colorBlendAttachment.colorWriteMask = VK_COLOR_COMPONENT_R_BIT | VK_COLOR_COMPONENT_G_BIT | VK_COLOR_COMPONENT_B_BIT | VK_COLOR_COMPONENT_A_BIT;
colorBlendAttachment.blendEnable = VK_FALSE;
colorBlendAttachment.srcColorBlendFactor = VK_BLEND_FACTOR_ONE; // Optional
colorBlendAttachment.dstColorBlendFactor = VK_BLEND_FACTOR_ZERO; // Optional
colorBlendAttachment.colorBlendOp = VK_BLEND_OP_ADD; // Optional
colorBlendAttachment.srcAlphaBlendFactor = VK_BLEND_FACTOR_ONE; // Optional
colorBlendAttachment.dstAlphaBlendFactor = VK_BLEND_FACTOR_ZERO; // Optional
colorBlendAttachment.alphaBlendOp = VK_BLEND_OP_ADD; // Optional
```

This per-framebuffer struct allows you to configure the first way of color
blending. The operations that will be performed are best demonstrated using the
following pseudocode:

```c++
if (blendEnable) {
    finalColor.rgb = (srcColorBlendFactor * newColor.rgb) <colorBlendOp> (dstColorBlendFactor * oldColor.rgb);
    finalColor.a = (srcAlphaBlendFactor * newColor.a) <alphaBlendOp> (dstAlphaBlendFactor * oldColor.a);
} else {
    finalColor = newColor;
}

finalColor = finalColor & colorWriteMask;
```

If `blendEnable` is set to `VK_FALSE`, then the new color from the fragment
shader is passed through unmodified. Otherwise, the two mixing operations are
performed to compute a new color. The resulting color is AND'd with the
`colorWriteMask` to determine which channels are actually passed through.

The most common way to use color blending is to implement alpha blending, where
we want the new color to be blended with the old color based on its opacity. The
`finalColor` should then be computed as follows:

```c++
finalColor.rgb = newAlpha * newColor + (1 - newAlpha) * oldColor;
finalColor.a = newAlpha.a;
```

This can be accomplished with the following parameters:

```c++
colorBlendAttachment.blendEnable = VK_TRUE;
colorBlendAttachment.srcColorBlendFactor = VK_BLEND_FACTOR_SRC_ALPHA;
colorBlendAttachment.dstColorBlendFactor = VK_BLEND_FACTOR_ONE_MINUS_SRC_ALPHA;
colorBlendAttachment.colorBlendOp = VK_BLEND_OP_ADD;
colorBlendAttachment.srcAlphaBlendFactor = VK_BLEND_FACTOR_ONE;
colorBlendAttachment.dstAlphaBlendFactor = VK_BLEND_FACTOR_ZERO;
colorBlendAttachment.alphaBlendOp = VK_BLEND_OP_ADD;
```

You can find all of the possible operations in the `VkBlendFactor` and
`VkBlendOp` enumerations in the specification.

The second structure references the array of structures for all of the
framebuffers and allows you to set blend constants that you can use as blend
factors in the aforementioned calculations. 

```c++
VkPipelineColorBlendStateCreateInfo colorBlending = {};
colorBlending.sType = VK_STRUCTURE_TYPE_PIPELINE_COLOR_BLEND_STATE_CREATE_INFO;
colorBlending.logicOpEnable = VK_FALSE;
colorBlending.logicOp = VK_LOGIC_OP_COPY; // Optional
colorBlending.attachmentCount = 1;
colorBlending.pAttachments = &colorBlendAttachment;
colorBlending.blendConstants[0] = 0.0f; // Optional
colorBlending.blendConstants[1] = 0.0f; // Optional
colorBlending.blendConstants[2] = 0.0f; // Optional
colorBlending.blendConstants[3] = 0.0f; // Optional
```

If you want to use the second method of blending (bitwise combination), then you
should set `logicOpEnable` to `VK_TRUE`. The bitwise operation can then be
specified in the `logicOp` field. Note that this will automatically disable the
first method, as if you had set `blendEnable` to `VK_FALSE` for every
attached framebuffer! The `colorWriteMask` will also be used in this mode to
determine which channels in the framebuffer will actually be affected. It is
also possible to disable both modes, as we've done here, in which case the
fragment colors will be written to the framebuffer unmodified.

## Dynamic state

A limited amount of the state that we've specified in the previous structs *can*
actually be changed without recreating the pipeline. Examples are the size of
the viewport, line width and blend constants. If you want to do that, then
you'll have to fill in a `VkPipelineDynamicStateCreateInfo` structure like this:

```c++
VkDynamicState dynamicStates[] = {
    VK_DYNAMIC_STATE_VIEWPORT,
    VK_DYNAMIC_STATE_LINE_WIDTH
};

VkPipelineDynamicStateCreateInfo dynamicState = {};
dynamicState.sType = VK_STRUCTURE_TYPE_PIPELINE_DYNAMIC_STATE_CREATE_INFO;
dynamicState.dynamicStateCount = 2;
dynamicState.pDynamicStates = dynamicStates;
```

This will cause the configuration of these values to be ignored and you will be
required to specify the data at drawing time. We'll get back to this in a future
chapter. This struct can be substituted by a `nullptr` later on if you don't
have any dynamic state.

## Pipeline layout

You can use `uniform` values in shaders, which are globals similar to dynamic
state variables that can be changed at drawing time to alter the behavior of
your shaders without having to recreate them. They are commonly used to pass the
transformation matrix to the vertex shader, or to create texture samplers in the
fragment shader.

These uniform values need to be specified during pipeline creation by creating a
`VkPipelineLayout` object. Even though we won't be using them until a future
chapter, we are still required to create an empty pipeline layout.

Create a class member to hold this object, because we'll refer to it from other
functions at a later point in time:

```c++
VkPipelineLayout pipelineLayout;
```

And then create the object in the `createGraphicsPipeline` function:

```c++
VkPipelineLayoutCreateInfo pipelineLayoutInfo = {};
pipelineLayoutInfo.sType = VK_STRUCTURE_TYPE_PIPELINE_LAYOUT_CREATE_INFO;
pipelineLayoutInfo.setLayoutCount = 0; // Optional
pipelineLayoutInfo.pSetLayouts = nullptr; // Optional
pipelineLayoutInfo.pushConstantRangeCount = 0; // Optional
pipelineLayoutInfo.pPushConstantRanges = 0; // Optional

if (vkCreatePipelineLayout(device, &pipelineLayoutInfo, nullptr, &pipelineLayout) != VK_SUCCESS) {
    throw std::runtime_error("failed to create pipeline layout!");
}
```

The structure also specifies *push constants*, which are another way of passing
dynamic values to shaders that we may get into in a future chapter. The pipeline
layout is may be referenced throughout the program's lifetime, so it should be
destroyed at the end:

```c++
void cleanup() {
    vkDestroyPipelineLayout(device, pipelineLayout, nullptr);
    ...
}
```

## Conclusion

That's it for all of the fixed-function state! It's a lot of work to set all of
this up from scratch, but the advantage is that we're now nearly fully aware of
everything that is going on in the graphics pipeline! This reduces the chance of
running into unexpected behavior because the default state of certain components
is not what you expect.

There is however one more object to create before we can finally create the
graphics pipeline and that is a [render pass](!Drawing_a_triangle/Graphics_pipeline_basics/Render_passes).
